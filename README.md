# odin-recipes

This project will be a website, the homepage will have links to a few different cooking recipes
In those links will be webpages that contain the appropriate recipe

I will be demonstrating the following skills I have learnt so far:
- html webpage setup and key info
- html tags utilization
- html links and images utilization
- using git for version control
- utilize CSS for styling
